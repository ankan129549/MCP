Of course. Here are the implementation notes for the final `server.py` and `client1.py` files.

### \#\# **`server.py` Implementation Notes**

This script implements a robust, tool-based server that acts as a controlled gateway to a GitHub repository and a local documentation directory. Its primary architectural feature is a dual rate-limiting system.

-----

#### **Core Features**

  * **Tool-Based Architecture**: Uses the `fastmcp` library to expose discrete functions (`get_repository`, `get_file_content`, etc.) as "tools" that can be called remotely.
  * **Outbound GitHub API Rate Limiting**: The server's most critical feature is its ability to manage its own usage of the GitHub API. It tracks its outgoing requests to ensure it stays within GitHub's limits (5000/hour for authenticated requests, 1000/hour for unauthenticated).
  * **State Persistence**: The outbound rate limit count is stored in a `rate_limit_state.json` file, making the count persistent even if the server is restarted.
  * **Dynamic Authentication**: The server can run with or without a `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It automatically detects the token's presence and adjusts the outbound rate limit accordingly.
  * **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses `httpx` for non-blocking, asynchronous calls to the GitHub API, ensuring the server remains responsive under load.

-----

#### **Key Components**

  * **Configuration (`dotenv`)**: All sensitive and environment-specific variables (API tokens, repository names) are loaded from a `.env` file for security and portability.
  * **The "Gatekeeper" Function (`make_github_api_request`)**: This is the heart of the outbound rate limiting. All tools that need to contact the GitHub API must go through this central function. It checks the current usage against the limit *before* making the request, updates the count, and resets the hourly window when necessary.
  * **Tool Functions (`@mcp.tool`)**: Each function decorated with `@mcp.tool()` becomes an endpoint. They are designed to be simple, containing only the business logic for their specific task, and they rely on the gatekeeper for API access.
  * **Server Runner (`uvicorn`)**: The script is a standard ASGI application and is run using `uvicorn`, a production-ready server.

-----

#### **Dependencies**

  * `fastmcp`: The core library for creating the tool-based server.
  * `python-dotenv`: For loading the `.env` configuration file.
  * `httpx`: The asynchronous HTTP client used to call the GitHub API.


-----

#### **Setup and Running**

1.  Create a `.env` file in the same directory with `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional.
2.  Run the server from the terminal using `python server.py`.

### \#\# **`client.py` Implementation Notes**

This script is an asynchronous command-line client designed specifically to interact with and test the `server.py`. It provides a structured way to call the server's tools and inspect their responses.

-----

#### **Core Features**

  * **Asynchronous Client**: Built entirely on `asyncio` and the `fastmcp.Client` to efficiently communicate with the asynchronous server.
  * **Command-Line Interface**: Uses `argparse` to provide simple flags (`--test-github`, `--test-docs`, `--test-all`) for running specific sets of tests. If no flag is provided, it defaults to running all tests.
  * **Formatted Output**: Includes a helper function (`print_response`) that neatly formats and prints the JSON data returned by the server, making it easy to read and debug.
  * **Targeted Test Functions**: The logic is organized into separate async functions (`test_github_tools`, `test_docs_tool`) for each category of tools, making the code clean and extensible.

-----

#### **Dependencies**

  * `fastmcp`: Required for the `Client` class used to connect to the server.

-----

#### **Usage**

The client is run from the command line.

  * **Run all tests**:
    ```bash
    python client1.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python client1.py --test-all
    ```
  * **Run only GitHub-related tests**:
    ```bash
    python client1.py --test-github
    ```
  * **Run only the documentation search test**:
    ```bash
    python client1.py --test-docs
    ```
