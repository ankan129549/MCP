def generate_python_function(description: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a Python function from a natural language description using an LLM.

    This function constructs a few-shot prompt to guide a generative AI model
    to produce only the Python code corresponding to the input description,
    without any surrounding text or markdown formatting.

    Args:
        description: A natural language string describing the function to be created.
                     Example: "Create a Python function named 'calculate_average' that
                     takes a list of numbers and returns their average."

    Returns:
        A string containing only the generated Python code.
        
    Note:
        This function requires a configured generative AI model. For this example,
        we use the 'google.generativeai' library. You would need to set up your
        API key, for instance, as an environment variable 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'.
    """
    
    # In a real application, you would configure the API key.
    # For example: genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])
    # model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')

    # The prompt is structured with a clear instruction and examples (few-shot)
    # to guide the model's output format. This ensures the output is clean code.

You are an expert Python code generation assistant. Your task is to take a natural language description of a Python function and generate only the corresponding 
Python code.Do not include any explanations, introductory text, comments, or markdown formatting like ```python. Just provide the raw code.
