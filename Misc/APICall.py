# --- Core Function ---

def classify_and_prioritize(ticket_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Classifies a support ticket and assigns a priority using an OpenAI model.

    This function uses a system prompt with few-shot examples to guide the model
    into providing a structured JSON output. It leverages OpenAI's JSON mode
    for reliable output.

    Args:
        ticket_text: The raw text from the user's support ticket.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the 'category' and 'priority',
        e.g., {"category": "Bug", "priority": "High"}.
        Returns an error dictionary if parsing fails.

    You are an expert ticket classification system.
    Analyze the user's support ticket and classify it into one of five categories
    (Bug, Feature Request, Question, Praise, Complaint) and assign a priority
    (Low, Medium, High).

    You must return ONLY a valid JSON object with two keys: "category" and "priority".

    Here are some examples:
    - Ticket: "I can't log in! The app crashes every time I enter my password."
    - Output: {"category": "Bug", "priority": "High"}

    - Ticket: "It would be great if you could add a dark mode."
    - Output: {"category": "Feature Request", "priority": "Medium"}

    - Ticket: "How do I change my profile picture?"
    - Output: {"category": "Question", "priority": "Low"}
