    "page_content": "step closer to this vision as we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we’ve ever built.Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video. Gemini is also our most flexible model yet — able to efficiently run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Its state-of-the-art capabilities will significantly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI.We’ve optimized Gemini 1.0, our first version, for three different sizes:Gemini Ultra — our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.Gemini Pro — our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.Gemini Nano — our most efficient model for on-device tasks. State-of-the-art",
